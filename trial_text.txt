Objectives: To assess the safety and ef cacy of an allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell preparation
(MAG200) in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis over 12 months.
Design: A single-centre, double-blind, ascending dose, randomised controlled trial. 40 participants with moderate
knee osteoarthritis were randomised to receive a single intra-articular injection of MAG200 (dose cohorts:10, 20,
50, 100 106 cells) or placebo. Primary objectives were safety and ef cacy according to a compound responder
analysis of minimal clinically important difference in pain (numerical pain rating scale [NPRS]) and function
(Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score - Function in Daily Living subscale [KOOSADL]) at month 12.
Secondary ef cacy outcomes included changes from baseline in patient reported outcome measures and evalu-
ation of disease-modi cation using quantitative MRI.
Results: Treatment was well tolerated with no treatment-related serious adverse events. MAG200 cohorts reported
a greater proportion of responders than placebo and demonstrated clinical and statistically signi cant improve-
ment in pain and clinically relevant improvement in all KOOS subscales. MAG200 demonstrated a reproducible
treatment effect over placebo, which was clinically relevant for pain in the 10 106 dose cohort (mean difference
NPRS:-2.25[95%CI:-4.47,-0.03, p¼ 0.0468]) and for function in the 20 106 and 100 106 dose cohorts (mean
difference KOOSADL:10.12[95%CI:-1.51,21.76, p¼ 0.0863] and 10.81[95%CI:-1.42,23.04, p¼ 0.0810] respec-
tively). A trend in disease-modi cation was observed with improvement in total knee cartilage volume in
MAG200 10, 20, and 100 106 dose cohorts, with progression of osteoarthritis in placebo, though this was not
statistically signi cant. No clear dose response was observed.
Conclusion: This early-phase study provides supportive safety and ef cacy evidence to progress MAG200 to later-
stage trial development.

Globally over 650 million individuals aged 40 years or more are
affected by knee osteoarthritis (OA) [1]. This progressive condition is a
leading cause of disability, and is associated with signi cant economic
and healthcare burden [1]. In the absence of disease-modifying treat-
ment, the current management of knee OA remains limited [2], with
surgical total knee replacement (TKR) considered when conservative
therapies have failed. Whilst registry data supports long-term durability
of TKR [3], clinically meaningful pain reduction and functional outcomes
can be sub-optimal in approximately 30% of patients [4], with the risk of
serious post-surgical complications including infection, myocardial
infarction, stroke and death not insigni cant [5].
Intra-articular (IA) therapies, which aim to improve pain and func-
tion, are frequently considered [6]. The most common IA treatments are
corticosteroids and viscosupplements (hyaluronic-acid) with increased
use of orthobiological preparations including platelet-rich plasma [7].
Whilst corticosteroids are recommended in international guidelines there
is an acceptance that they have limited bene t beyond 3–4 weeks and are
associated with an observed increase in OA progression with repetitive
use [8]. Comparably, viscosupplements demonstrate unpredictable
improvement beyond 6 months and have limited bene t over placebo
[9], with recent systematic review and meta-analysis not supporting their
broad use in the treatment of knee OA [10]. Whilst PRP is associated with
modest clinical bene t up to 12 months, its use is not recommended in
current international clinical practice guidelines due to lack of evidence
to de nitively recommend its use [11]. Importantly, current therapies
are not associated with disease-modi cation [12], and therefore have
limited impact on the increasing incidence of TKR and associated so-
cioeconomic burden.
The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has emerged as a prom-
ising approach to address the unmet clinical need of OA [13]. MSCs are
multipotent cells with the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts, adi-
pocytes and chondroblasts [14]. MSCs are observed to directly modulate
in ammation by suppression of in ammatory cell proliferation, reduc-
tion in pro-in ammatory cytokines (IL-1 and IL-6) with polarisation of
M1 macrophages to an anti-in ammatory M2 phenotype in addition to
inhibition of TNFα with expression of solubleTNF receptor-1 (sTNFR1)
[15]. Reduction/inhibition of such in ammatory cytokines leads to
reduced expression of nerve growth factor with inhibition of nociceptive
sensitisation leading to improvement in pain [16]. Additionally, MSC
secretion of trophic cytokines, including transforming growth factor
(TGFβ1), may result in local tissue repair [17,18]. The ability of MSCs to
differentiate into chondrocytes, as well as their observed immunomo-
dulatory/anti-in ammatory and trophic/reparative actions [19], has
fuelled interest in their application in OA [20]. A growing body of
pre-clinical and clinical evidence supports sustained improvements in
pain and function after IA injections of MSCs [21,22], in addition to
observed disease-modi cation with stabilisation or delay in OA pro-
gression [13,23].
Whilst autologous MSC therapies continue to be investigated [24],
methods to achieve isolated autologous MSC preparations are labour
intensive, require a surgical harvest procedure and are costly, therefore
limiting their widespread clinical application. Conversely, allogeneic
MSC preparations offer the potential of a scalable‘off-the-shelf’ therapy
[25,26]. Importantly, due to lack of expression of immune relevant sur-
face markers, MSCs are considered to be immune“evasive” [27], and are
regarded as safe to use in genetically unmatched recipients [28].
Building on our prior research assessing the administration of autol-
ogous adipose-derived MSCs (ADMSCs) [29,30], the present study re-
ports the effect of a de ned allogeneic ADMSC cell-line in the treatment
of knee OA. The overall purpose of this double blinded,
placebo-controlled, randomised Phase I/IIa study was to evaluate the
safety and preliminary ef cacy of ascending doses of an allogeneic
ADMSC therapy preparation to inform optimal dose selection for its
application in knee OA and later-stage pivotal trials.

2. Methods
2.1. Design, randomisation and participants
This randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, prospective study
was conducted at the Melbourne Stem Cell Centre Research, Victoria,
Australia. The study was approved by the Charles Sturt University
Human Research Ethics Committee, NSW, Australia and conducted in
accordance with ethical principles founded in the Declaration of Helsinki
(Registration ACTRN12617001095358 / ACTRN12621000622808).
All participants provided written informed consent prior to screening.
Eligible participants were aged 18–65 years inclusive, with documented
radiological diagnosis of moderate knee OA (Kellgren-Lawrence Grade
2–3). All participants had attempted primary conservative management
of OA and had an average pain score in the preceding week of 5
(Numeric Pain Rating Scale [NPRS]). (See Supplementary Table-S1.
Eligibility Criteria).
A de ned cell-line of allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs (ADMSCs)
(company development code– MAG200) was provided by trial sponsor
Magellan Stem Cells Pty Ltd (Victoria, Australia). The study comprised an
ascending dose phase to determine short-term (3 months) safety of
MAG200 administered as a single IA injection and a follow-up phase to
evaluate preliminary ef cacy and longer-term safety over 12 months. 40
participants were equally allocated to one of four ascending dose cohorts
with each cohort comprising 10 participants randomized in a ratio of 4:1
to receive either MAG200 or placebo. This resulted in the four active
treatment doses (MAG200 10, 20, 50, 100 106 cells) and placebo being
represented equally with 8 participants (1:1:1:1:1) (Supplementary
Fig. S1). As this was a‘ rst-in-human’ study a sentinel group approach
was used, with randomisation forced so that the rst two participants in
each dose cohort were allocated 1:1 to MAG200 or placebo. In the
absence of any safety issues after 48 h, the remaining participants in each
dose cohort were enrolled and randomised using a computer-generated
randomisation schedule. Escalation to the next dose level occurred
when safety data for the preceding dose level cohort was deemed
acceptable at 1 month of follow-up.
Study participants and all study personnel directly involved with
participant care/treatment were blinded to the treatment allocation
throughout the trial.
2.2. Patient and public involvement
Prior to commencement of the study, we sought patient feedback
regarding design and conduct of the study. This was to ensure that
treatment re ected what would be acceptable in the broader community
in addition to reducing chance of lost to follow-up.
2.3. Preparation of allogeneic ADMSCs
The ADMSCs were derived from a single donor and underwent
isolation and expansion following good laboratory and clinical practices
[31] in accordance with Magellan Stem Cells standard operating pro-
cedures [29,30]. Donation and testing relevant to the procurement of
donor tissue was performed according to regulatory guidelines [32–35].
A lipoharvest was performed by a quali ed clinician following previously
reported protocols and transferred to the Magellan laboratory for
manufacturing of the investigational product (MAG200) [29]. The lip-
oharvest underwent enzymatic digestion followed by centrifugation at
2000 rpm for 10 min. The pelleted cell mixture was then washed with
sterile buffer solution with the nal cell pellet resuspended in culture
media and termed Stromal Vascular Fractions. The SVF was plated on to
sterile tissue culture asks for culture puri cation. After 72 h,
non-adherent cells were removed and adhered cells were incubated with
standard growth media containing fetal-bovine serum at 37 C for 7–10
days until 80–90% con uence. Cells were expanded for a total of 4
passages (equivalent of 10–15 doublings). MAG200 was characterised
2J. Freitag et al. following International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy guidelines,
including tri-lineage differentiation and expression of CD105, CD73, and
CD90 ( 95% positive) and lack of expression of hematopoietic markers
CD45, CD14, CD34, and CD19 ( 2% positive) [36]. Cell morphology,
count and viability were recorded. In addition, MAG200 underwent
sterility, mycoplasma and endotoxin analysis and karyotype stability
testing.
MAG200 was stored in individual sterile cryovials stored in liquid
nitrogen. Each cryovial contained 10 million cells in a volume of 1 mL
cryoprotectant media (CryoStor®CS10, Biolife-Solutions, Washington,
USA). When required, the appropriate number of cryovials were removed
from the liquid nitrogen, thawed at 37 C in a sterile water bath and
centrifuged to remove cryoprotectant media. The resultant pelleted cells
were reconstituted with 5 mL of sterile clinical grade injectable isotonic
electrolyte solution (Plasma-Lyte 148 IV-Infusion, Baxter Healthcare Pty
Ltd, NSW, Australia). Cell count and viability were con rmed using an
automated cell counter (MUSE Cell Analyser, Merck, MA, USA) (Table 1).
All treatments including placebo (5 mL Plasma-Lyte) were prepared and
supplied to the clinical trial site in identical syringes with the syringe
barrels covered in black tape to prevent unblinding.
2.4. Justification of the dose range
We chose 10 106 MSCs as an appropriate starting dose as past
research suggested this was safe and associated with pain and functional
improvement though not associated with disease-modi cation [37]. We
have previously shown ef cacy of high dose (100 106) ADMSC prep-
arations with observed disease-modi cation and hence chose 100 106
cells as the maximal dose cohort [29].
2.5. Intervention
The area of injection site super cial to the knee joint capsule was rst
anaesthetised using 2 mL of 2% xylocaine. Intra-articular injection of the
investigational product was performed under ultrasound guidance using
a 21-gauge needle and via a superolateral patellofemoral approach. Post-
treatment, participants were observed for 1 h and provided with a pre-
scription for appropriate analgesia, a compression garment, and an ice
pack. Full weight-bearing was allowed. We asked participants to refrain
from strenuous weight-bearing exercise/activities for 1 week following
treatment.
2.6. Study outcomes and participant assessments
The primary safety objective was to evaluate the safety of a single
dose of MAG200 within the initial post-treatment period (0–3 months)
via monitoring of adverse events (Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events-Version 5.0), physical examinations, concomitant medi-
cation usage and clinical laboratory tests.
The primary ef cacy objective was to evaluate the effect of a single
dose of MAG200 on knee pain and function at 12 months. The primary
ef cacy endpoint was a compound responder analysis as determined by
improvement in pain (numeric pain rating scale [NPRS]) and function
(Knee Injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Function in Daily Living
Osteoarthritis and Cartilage Open 6 (2024) 100500
subscale [KOOSADL]). A responder was de ned as a participant in
whom there was a clinically meaningful improvement (minimum
clinically important difference [MCID]) in pain with no loss of function
or a clinically meaningful improvement in function with no increase in
pain. MCID were de ned as a 2 point reduction (or 30% reduction)
in NPRS for pain and a change from baseline of 8 points on the
KOOSADL subscale for function [38,39]. We chose a responder analysis
as it provides a clinically relevant composite endpoint which takes pain
and function into account, and has been shown to be more sensitive
than mean changes in pain scores when assessing drug ef cacy in knee
OA [40,41].
Secondary ef cacy objectives were to determine change from baseline
to month 12 in patient reported outcome measures and knee joint
structure. NPRS and KOOSADL which formed part of the responder anal-
ysis were considered key secondary endpoints. PROMs were completed at
baseline, months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 and included:
- Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS): An 11-point scale was used with
participants asked to rate their average knee pain over the previous
week (0¼ no pain, 10¼ worst pain). NPRS is a validated primary
outcome measure of OA pain intensity [42].
- Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS): KOOS eval-
uates short and long-term consequences of knee injury and OA and
consists of ve subscales: pain, symptoms, function in daily living,
function in sport and recreation, and knee-related quality of life. Each
subscale is comprised of a series of questions assessed using a ve-
point Likert scale. A score of 0–100 is derived for each subscale (0
¼ extreme knee problems, 100¼ no knee problems) [43].
- Orebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire Short Form (OMSPG-
Short): The OMSPQ-Short was completed at baseline and was used to
identify patients at risk of developing chronic pain; it comprises 10
questions each assessed with a score between 0 (no pain/dif culty) to
10. A total score >50 indicates an increased risk of long-term
disability.
- Global Perceived Effect (GPE): A seven-point patient GPE scale was
used, with participants indicating the overall change in their condi-
tion using a seven-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (completely
recovered) to 7 (worse than ever).
We performed structural/disease-modi cation assessment using
quantitative MRI (qMRI). The study knee was imaged in the sagittal plane
on a 3-T whole body MRI (Ingenia, Philips Medical Systems,
Netherlands) using a commercial transmit-receive extremity coil. The
following sequence and parameters were used: a T1-weighted fat sup-
pressed 3D gradient recall acquisition in the steady state; repetition time
18 msec; echo time 5 msec; ip angle 15 ; eld of view 16 cm; 640 640
matrix. Sagittal images were obtained at a partition thickness of 3.0 mm
with 1.5 mm spacing between slices, and in-plane resolution of 0.25
0.25 mm. Two-dimensional fast spin-echo, T2-mapping sequencing was
performed.
Cartilage volume within all compartments was determined, in
addition to the medial and lateral tibial plateau area using validated
methods [44]. The coef cient of variation was 2.0–3.4% for cartilage
volume and 2.4% for tibial plateau bone area [44]. T2-mapping is

[45], with increased super cial zone T2-values associated with reduced
cartilage quality and progression in OA [46]. T2-values >80 ms were
excluded as they represent tissue other than cartilage or result from
chemical shift artefact [47,48]. To reduce bias and ensure reproduc-
ibility of the MRI measurements, a trained observer, who was blinded
to participant characteristics, timing of MRI and group allocation, read
each MRI.

2.7. Statistical analyses
The sample size for this study was based on clinical and regulatory
considerations for rst-in-human studies [49]. All participants who un-
derwent randomisation and received study treatment, were included in
the safety and ef cacy analysis (intention-to-treat analysis).
Responder analysis was performed using a strati ed (by timepoint)
Cochrane Mantel Haenszel approach for each treatment dose, providing
estimates of the risk difference (active dose– placebo) and relative risk
with exact 95% con dence limits and an exact chi-square test to deter-
mine whether the responder rate in the active dose group was different
from (2-sided test) the placebo group at each timepoint.
To assess the effect of active treatment compared with placebo on
pain and function a mixed model was tted with change in NPRS or
KOOSsubscale as the outcome variable and dose and timepoint (and the
dose timepoint interaction) as factors. In addition, a customised esti-
mate was obtained for the difference between active and placebo for all
active doses combined. The effect of treatment on MRI data (cartilage

change from baseline as the outcome, dose as a factor and baseline value
as a covariate. Estimates of treatment effect (with 95% con dence limits)
were obtained for each assessment. The adjusted mean change from
baseline was tested within the model for each dose (including placebo).
As this was an early-stage exploratory ascending dose trial the level of
statistical signi cance was set at p < 0.05. A Bonferroni adjustment for
multiple comparisons was not made due to the potential risk of
increasing Type II errors and failing to detect real differences.
Safety data were summarised descriptively.
All statistical analyses were generated using SAS (Ver25.09.4, SAS
Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
3. Results
3.1. Baseline characteristics and study participants
A total of 49 participants were screened, of whom 40 met the inclu-
sion criteria and were enrolled, and completed the study as per the
protocol (Fig. 1). All cohorts had a mean BMI within the‘overweight’
range, included both male and female participants and included partic-
ipants who had undergone previous knee surgery (Table 2). The MAG200
Osteoarthritis and Cartilage Open 6 (2024) 100500
10 106 dose cohort had a greater mean age than other cohorts and
recorded a higher mean OMSPQ-Short score suggesting an increased risk
of long-term pain/disability. In contrast, the placebo group was
comprised of a higher proportion of males (7:1), and younger partici-
pants with less severe OA and lower OMPSQ-Short scores compared with
other cohorts.
3.2. Safety outcomes
In the initial 0–3-month post-treatment period, 32 (80%) participants
reported 57 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), the majority of
which were mild (41, 72%). The most commonly occurring TEAEs were
arthralgia, injection-site related swelling and effusion (occurring 24 h
after injection), injection site pain, and joint swelling and effusion
(occurring >24 h after injection). Treatment-related TEAEs were
observed only in the MAG200 groups (23, 40%), the majority of which
were mild (17, 74%). The most common TEAE was injection site related
effusion (8 participants) and swelling (6 participants). A dose-related
increase in the proportion of participants reporting treatment-related
TEAEs was observed (13% in the lowest dose [MAG200 10 106]
group and 100% in the highest dose [MAG200 100 106] group). There
was no observed dose-dependent relationship on severity of TEAEs and

there were no treatment-related serious TEAEs (Table 3). No treatment-
related changes in vital signs, laboratory tests or electrocardiograms were
observed.
Use of concomitant medications was more frequent in the initial 0-3-
month post treatment period than during longer-term follow-up (22
participants [18 MAG200, 3 placebo] vs. 4 participants [3 MAG200, 1
placebo], respectively).
3.3. Efficacy outcomes
At month 12, all MAG200 dose cohorts exhibited a greater number of
responders than placebo (50% placebo group, 62.5% MAG200 10 106
,
100% MAG200 20 106, 62.5% MAG200 50 106, and 75% MAG200
100 106) (Supplementary Fig. S2). The MAG200 20 106 dose group
demonstrated a doubling of response rate compared with placebo (rela-
tive risk¼ 2.0).
A clinically relevant ( 2 point decrease) and statistically signi cant
improvement in pain from baseline at month 12 was observed in all
MAG200 cohorts, but not in the placebo group which failed to achieve
statistically signi cant or clinically relevant improvement (Table 4,
Fig. 2). A clinically relevant ( 8 point increase) and statistically signif-
icant improvement from baseline to month 12 was observed in KOOSADL
for MAG200 10, 20, and 100 106 dose groups and in all other KOOS
subscales for all MAG200 cohorts with most subscales indicating
clinically relevant improvement as early as 3 months post treatment
(Table 4, Figs. 2 and 3).
At month 12, MAG200 therapy was associated with a positive treat-
ment effect against placebo with greater pain reduction, irrespective of
the dose received (Fig. 4). The greatest treatment effect was seen in the
MAG200 10 106 dose cohort, which was both statistically signi cant
(p¼ 0.0468) and clinically relevant. Further, estimates of treatment ef-
fect showed improvements beyond placebo in all ve KOOS subscales for
participants in the MAG200 10, 20 and 100 106 dose groups with the
MAG200 100 106 dose group showing clinically relevant improvement
against placebo in all subscales (Fig. 5).
Estimates of the treatment effects of MAG200 on pain reduction
(NPRS) and functional improvement (KOOSADL) at all time points show
treatment effect against placebo as early as 3 months with sustained
treatment effect out to month 12 (Supplementary Figs. S3,S4).
At month 12, based on GPE, more patients who had received MAG200
treatment reported improvement or complete recovery from symptoms of
knee OA compared with placebo (75% vs 37.5%) (Supplementary
Fig. S5).

dose cohorts, though these changes did not reach statistical signi cance
(Supplementary Fig. S6). Assessment of treatment effect indicated most
signi cant change in lateral femoral condyle cartilage volume, which
was statistically signi cant in the MAG200 20 106 dose cohort (p¼
0.032) and MAG200 at all doses (p¼ 0.037) (Supplementary Fig. S7).
Although no results reached statistical signi cance, the observed treat-
ment effects on cartilage quality, as measured by change in super cial
zone T2-mapping values, favoured the MAG200 100 106 dose group
with improvement in the medial ( 0.46 [95%CI:-3.74,2.82]), lateral
( 0.07 [95%CI:-2.70,2.57]), patellofemoral compartments ( 0.03 [95%
CI:-2.92,2.86]) and total knee average ( 0.30 [95%CI:-2.44,1.84]) when
compared against placebo (Supplementary Fig. S8). These results were in
contrast to change in femoral trochlea (1.67 [95%CI:-1.70,5.04] and
medial femoral condyle (0.53 [95%CI:-3.76,4.74] T2-values which fav-
oured placebo. Indicative qMRI images are displayed in Fig. 6.
4. Discussion
This rst-in-human double-blind, randomised controlled trial
assessing an allogeneic ADMSC preparation (MAG200), administered as
a single IA injection to the knee achieved its primary safety and ef cacy
outcomes. MAG200 therapy was observed to be well tolerated and safe
with the proportion of clinical responders being higher in all active
treatment groups than in placebo at 12 months.
The observed safety of IA MAG200 is consistent with other early-
phase trials evaluating allogeneic [50–52] or autologous [29,53,54]
ADMSC preparations [55]. Our results suggested a potential dose related
trend in treatment-related TEAE incidence, though there was no
observed dose relationship in severity of TEAEs.
Ef cacy endpoints were met as assessed by pain and functional im-
provements and observed treatment effect over placebo at 12 months. All
active treatment cohorts exhibited both clinically relevant and statisti-
cally signi cant improvement with 75% of patients receiving MAG200
reporting improvement or complete recovery. The observed response
following MAG200 therapy re ects previous early-phase trials using
allogeneic ADMSCs and supports the ef cacy of allogeneic ADMSCs in
the treatment of knee OA [50–52].
Quantitative disease-modi cation assessment indicated positive
treatment effects in favour of MAG200 in assessments of cartilage volume
at 12 months, with the most promising results seen in the 20 and 100
106 dose groups. qMRI T2-mapping indicated a dose response association
in disease-modi cation with improved total knee cartilage quality
against placebo observed in the MAG200 100 106 dose group, though
improved T2-values against placebo were not observed across all regions.
In comparison, outcomes of MRI-assessed structural changes after in-
jection of other allogeneic ADMSCs have been variable. Chen et al. re-
ported no improvements at 24 months of follow-up [52], while Kuah
et al. showed statistically signi cant greater cartilage loss with placebo
compared to active after 12 months of follow-up [50], and Lu et al.
showed improvements in cartilage volume only in a low dose group after
12 months [53]. Jo et al. in assessment of autologous ADMSC therapy
observed consistent radiological improvement after high dose therapy
(100 106 cells) in comparison to lower dose preparations which may
re ect a dose response disease-modi cation effect which is supported by
our results [56].
A focal interest of MSCs in the management of OA is their potential to
delay, defer and/or prevent TKR surgery through sustained pain and
functional improvement in addition to disease-modi cation. Unan-
swered questions remain as to the optimal cell tissue source, donor type
(allogeneic/autologous) and dose. Consistent with past meta-analysis
which report larger treatment effect bene ts for pain relief and carti-
lage repair with ADMSC than with bone-marrow derived MSCs (BM-
MSCs) [57], MAG200 therapy was associated with greater pain (NPRS)
improvement over placebo in direct comparison to studies involving
BM-MSCs [58]. This was additionally re ected in pain and functional

outcomes as measured by KOOS subscales where the MAG200 100 106
dose group exhibited a reproducible treatment effect and improvement
from baseline typically greater than that seen with BM-MSCs [59].
While 12-month qMRI results from our trial provide a promising
signal for potential disease-modi cation with MAG200, additional ana-
lyses may have provided supportive data. Importantly, T2-mapping
which has been validated as a non-invasive assessment of cartilage
quality remains an experimental endpoint as it has not been validated for
assessment of OA progression. Accordingly, future research may bene t
from analysis of disease-modi cation surrogate endpoints including
serum, synovial and urinary biomarkers (e.g. COMP, CTX-I/II, C2C)
which are less time dependent and serve as suitable supportive measures
of disease-modi cation [60].
Despite an ascending dose exploratory protocol, the results were
unable to provide clear direction as to the optimal dose of MAG200. Key
limitations which may have impacted this were the small sample size and
discrepancies in baseline demographic characteristics between cohorts.
Lack of clear intergroup differences between active treatment cohorts
may however be an indication of the ef cacy of MAG200 as a de ned
allogeneic cell line in the treatment of OA. Whilst variability may be
expected due to cohort sample size, the consistent statistically signi cant
and clinically relevant improvement from baseline and observed

treatment effect support the ef cacy of MAG200 in the treatment of OA.
There are no current disease-modifying therapies for OA. With the
growing incidence of OA and increasing rate of total joint replacement
the orthopaedic workforce may be insuf cient to meet demand with
recent research suggesting a need to increase the number of orthopaedic
surgeons by 10% every ve years [61]. For an OA therapy to be
considered disease-modifying and therefore delay and/or prevent TJR, it
should demonstrate both symptomatic (pain, function) and structural
bene ts [62]. The pain, functional and structural bene ts observed with
MAG200 suggests that MSC therapy may be an effective
disease-modifying treatment that promises to delay or prevent the need
for total joint replacement and thus reduce the growing clinical and
economic burden of OA.

5. Conclusion
OA is a major unmet clinical need and public health burden for which
preventative and reparative therapies are urgently needed. Allogeneic
MSC-based therapies offer an exciting possibility in the treatment of OA,
providing a scalable“off-the-shelf” solution. The results of this Phase I/
IIa study indicate that MAG200 has signi cant promise in the treatment
of knee OA and provide suf cient evidence to progress its clinical
development to later-stage trials.
